In Objective-C, a rare but frustrating error can occur when dealing with memory management and the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and manual memory management using `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  This typically happens when you mix ARC and manual retain/release calls, leading to unexpected retain counts and potential crashes.  For instance, if you manually retain an object that's already managed by ARC, then fail to release it appropriately, you'll create a memory leak or an object that's never deallocated, potentially resulting in a crash later.  Another subtle issue can arise with objects that are autoreleased but you unexpectedly retain them, preventing them from being released by the autorelease pool, and similarly leading to memory management errors.  The issue might be difficult to track down as the program may run seemingly fine for a time before exhibiting the error, making debugging complex.   Consider the example:

```objectivec
// Incorrectly managing memory
MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[obj retain]; // Manual retain, problematic with ARC
// ... use obj
[obj release]; // Missing a matching release, creating a leak
