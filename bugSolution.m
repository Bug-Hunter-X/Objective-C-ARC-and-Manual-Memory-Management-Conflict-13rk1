The solution involves avoiding manual memory management (`retain`, `release`, `autorelease`) when using ARC.  Let ARC handle retain counts. If you must interact with legacy code that uses manual memory management, ensure that every `retain` is matched by a corresponding `release`, to prevent memory leaks or double releases that lead to crashes.

```objectivec
// Corrected using ARC solely
MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
// ... use obj // ARC handles the release automatically
// No need for manual retain or release

//If manual management is absolutely necessary outside ARC:
MyObject *obj2 = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[obj2 retain];
//....use obj2
[obj2 release];
```

This revised approach prevents memory leaks or crashes by either letting ARC fully manage the object's lifecycle or explicitly managing it outside ARC in a well-balanced fashion.
